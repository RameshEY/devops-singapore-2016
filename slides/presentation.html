# Introduction to Ansible

* What is Ansible
* Why use Ansible
* Basic concepts
* Demo/Lab

---
# What is Ansible

* Configuration Management and Orchestration
  tool
* Repeatably put systems into a desired
  state
    - files
    - packages
    - services
    - ...

---
# Why use Ansible

* Easy to install
    - control machine needs ssh and python
    - target machine needs ssh (and preferably python)
    - no agents other than ssh required
* No complicated access control
    - if you can ssh to a target, you can run
      ansible against it with your privileges
    - you only get root power if you already
      have root access

---
# Why use Ansible

* Easy to do easy things with
* Not much harder to do hard things with
* Usually easy for others to understand what
  is going on

---
# Things people don't like

* YAML configuration and no more (unlike
  Chef or Puppet)
* Doesn't maintain desired state (unlike
  Puppet)

---
# Basic Concepts

---
# Lab

* Hopefully you received and followed the instructions
  to set up your Ansible environment.

* automatic page numbering works
* when no explicit footer is given, an implicit footer with information on the
lecture is inserted
* printing to pdf works: [zhaw_presentation.pdf](https://github.com/munen/p_slides/raw/themes/zhaw/zhaw_presentation.pdf)
* printed in chromium, a5, landscape mode
* printing is also tested in ff
* it might not work in an older ie, because it wouldn't take the background-colors of the header)
