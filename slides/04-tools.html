# Ansible From Zero to Best Practices

---

# Part 4: Tools

* syntax check
* check mode
* diff mode
* `ansible-doc`
* `ansible-lint`
* `ansible-review`

# Syntax Check

Ansible can check the syntax of a playbook using `--syntax-check` argument.

```
ansible-playbook --syntax-check examples/broken_yaml.yml
```

[FIXME: write example]



# Diff Mode

Diff mode is incredibly useful in conjunction with check mode to see
how a file would change, before the change is made. Diff mode can
be run using `-D` or `--diff-mode`



# ansible-doc

`ansible-doc` is very useful for finding the syntax
of a module without having to look it up online

```
> DEBUG

  This module prints statements during execution and can be useful for debugging variables or expressions without necessarily halting the playbook. Useful for debugging
  together with the 'when:' directive.

  * note: This module has a corresponding action plugin.

Options (= is mandatory):

- msg
        The customized message that is printed. If omitted, prints a generic message.
        [Default: Hello world!]
- var
        A variable name to debug.  Mutually exclusive with the 'msg' option.
        [Default: (null)]
- verbosity
        A number that controls when the debug is run, if you set to 3 it will only run debug when -vvv or above
        [Default: 0]
```

# ansible-lint

`ansible-lint` was developed to find various style and usage issues
with playbooks and roles, and suggest improvements.

There are several categories of rules
* Using command/shell module instead of Ansible modules
* Deprecated syntax that is being removed by Ansible
* Incorrect formatting

---
# ansible-lint

Every rule is treated as an error - there is no way to
mark rules as warnings. You can choose to run specific
rules or to exclude specific rules


---
# Standards and Best Practices

* Our standards, best practices, guide to code reviews etc. are in version
  control
* Our standards documentation is improved using a similar review process to our
  code. This is so that standards are agreed, and not imposed.
* Standards have a version number and a changelog, so that it's obvious what
  standards have been added, improved or even removed over time.

---
# Code Reviews

Code reviews are essential to maintaining the high quality of our codebase. We
use code reviews to check for standards compliance and best practices, and also
to ensure that the change is the right thing to do for future maintenance.

Code reviews can lead to less code in the codebase. This can be a good thing. By
spotting common patterns, functionality that is in a common role can be removed
from an application role (roles do not need to install apache themselves when
they can rely on the apache role, for example).

Conversely, code that is specific to an application should be kept away from the
more general roles.

---
# ansible-review

ansible-review is designed to apply an automated code
review process to work with an organisation's
standards.

As you add new standards to your style guide,
you can say what version of standards a playbook or role
is designed to meet. This allows older code to not fail
against newer standards.

---
# Running a review

After following the instructions on the
[ansible-review github repo](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-review)
you can run a review tool on just the changes
made against master

This can be run in any ansible repo, against roles or playbooks.
To run against all files in a repo (e.g. for a new role), just
use

```
git ls-files | xargs ansible-review
```

or

```
git diff master | ansible-review
```
